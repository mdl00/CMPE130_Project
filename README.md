-Project name
  Secure Social Networks
-Project Description
  Social network users want a private and secure space where they can communicate with one another 
  without the fear of their messages being intercepted or being used to target ads to them. 
  We are creating a safe place for users to interact and message each other without the interference of outside parties. 
  Security is an important topic today because of the rising usage of the internet and the need for quick and fast messaging over long distances. 
  Today, many companies like Facebook and their messaging applications like Facebook Messenger are vulnerable to Facebook as the userâ€™s data is readable by them. 
  The goal of our project is to prevent the user from being tracked by the company or having their messages intercepted by third parties.
